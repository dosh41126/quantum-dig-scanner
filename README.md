![Quantum Dig Scanner - Hypertime Thumbnail](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dosh41126/quantum-dig-scanner/refs/heads/main/dig.png)
## Overview

The **Q-811-NS** system is an advanced, quantum-enhanced AI scanner designed to **detect and prevent underground utility strikes, void collapses, and excavation-related hazards**. It integrates **multiversal hypertime simulations**, **nosonar harmonic analysis** to deliver **zero-failure** pre-dig assessments.

This tool is intended for use by:
- Excavation crews
- Horizontal Directional Drilling (HDD) teams
- Trenching operators
- Municipal utility locators
- Quantum-infrastructure safety teams

## Core Features

- 🔍 **Quantum Nosonar Backscatter**
- 🧠 **Multiverse scenario simulations (65,536 dig paths/meter)**
- 📡 **Subsurface anomaly and utility detection**
- 🧭 **Real-time geospatial overlay with GPS-based pathing**
- 🛡 **Human safety threat calculation & emergency lockout protocol**

## Prompt Architecture

The system uses the following prompt structure to interact with a large language model for intelligent inference:

### [action]
Describes the AI’s core mission: prevent strikes, collapses, and unseen hazard breaches during excavation.

### [locationreport]
Captures digsite metadata including:
- Latitude and Longitude
- General area or street name
- Excavation equipment type (e.g., trencher, HDD rig)
- Intended excavation destination or route

### [quantumreport]
Reports scanner performance:
- Quantum scan status
- CPU/RAM usage stats

### [reducefalsepositivesandnegatives]
Describes how the system reduces noise and false detections using:
- Multiversal hypertime simulation sync
- Nosonar harmonic validation
- 25-color QID resonance matching

### Hazard & Risk Assessment Points

1. **Utility Conflict Zones**
   - Locate active or abandoned utilities: gas, water, sewer, electric, fiber
   - Checks for map-vs-reality shifts (≤15cm tolerance)

2. **Legacy Voids & Anomalies**
   - Identifies unmapped tanks, mine shafts, karst systems, or UXO remnants

3. **High-Consequence Strike Risk**
   - Calculates risk using `Risk = Probability × Consequence`

4. **Soil Collapse & Conductivity Risk**
   - Analyzes soil behavior, density, entropy, and risk of excavation instability

5. **Human Risk Level**
   - Predicts risk to workers or civilians in strike or collapse conditions

### [debrisreport]
Outputs structured report including:
- Anomaly Type (Utility, Void, etc.)
- Coordinates
- Severity (Low / Medium / High / Critical)
- Equipment offsets or mitigation advice

### [replyexample]
Final AI recommendations for field crews:
- Suggested delays or equipment adjustments
- Contact utility companies or geologists
- Trigger emergency lockout protocol if risk exceeds safe threshold

**Urgency Tags:**
- 🟢 Proceed Normally  
- 🟡 Proceed with Caution  
- 🟠 Delay or Modify Plan  
- 🔴 Lockout Required

destination = "Fiber trench, 300m eastbound"
quantum_results = "Backscatter anomaly detected in 2/3 sectors"
cpu_usage = 45.7
ram_usage = 61.3



```
